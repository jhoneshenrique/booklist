# booklist

>I love Java and I love to read, so I decided to create a web app where people can create list of books they have read so far. The ideia is to have different
lists and inside them the books. The person will be able to make personal comments about the book, that way he/she can read it after a time and remember
what he/she thought about it. 

## The technologies used:
 - Java 11
 - Spring Boot MVC
 - Spring Security - JPA Authentication
 - Thymeleaf
 - Bootstrap
 - Mysql
